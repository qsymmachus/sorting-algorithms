# Insertion sort is not as efficient with large lists as more advanced algorithms 
# like merge sort or quicksort. Insertion sorts average case performance is O(n^2). 
# However, it does have advantages. Insertion sort is typically:
# - Efficient with lists that are already mostly sorted ("adaptive")
# â€“ Makes efficient use of memory since it is performed in-place.
